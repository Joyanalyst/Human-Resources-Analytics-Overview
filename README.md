 Workforce, Attrition, and Retention Insights
## Project Overview
#### This project analyzed a six-year HR dataset to understand workforce composition, attrition patterns, tenure distribution, and employee engagement indicators. The primary objective was to support HR decision-making by identifying key drivers of employee turnover and retention risks across departments, age groups, tenure bands, and employment types. The dashboard was designed with recruiters and HR leadership in mind, prioritizing clarity, relevance, and actionable insights. All analyses were focused on delivering practical recommendations to guide workforce strategy and decision-making. Analysis and visualizations were performed using Excel, Power Query, and Power BI.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
#### o	Standardized date formats and corrected inconsistent text values using Power Query
#### o	Handled missing exit dates and employment statuses appropriately
#### o	Created calculated columns for tenure, age, age groups, and tenure bands
#### o	Created a date table for time series analysis
#### o	Derived Employee Engagement Index using weighted HR indicators

## Executive Summary
#### The organization maintains an active workforce of approximately 2,000 employees, with an overall attrition rate of 51% and a retention rate of 49%, indicating moderate workforce instability over the six years. The Employee Engagement Index of 58.39 suggests moderate engagement levels, which may not be sufficient to sustain long-term employee retention. Analysis of exit patterns reveals that nearly 49% of all employee exits occur within the first year of employment, indicating that early tenure is the most vulnerable period for turnover. Exit concentration declines significantly with longer tenure, indicating improved retention among more established employees. Department-level analysis identified the Executive Office (80%) and Admin Offices (60%) as the highest attrition risk areas, with rates significantly exceeding the organizational average. These trends indicate potential department-specific retention challenges that may require targeted intervention. Trend analysis over time reveals that attrition has remained consistently elevated, with only minor year-to-year fluctuations, suggesting that it is not driven by isolated events but rather reflects persistent structural or workforce-related factors.

## Insights
### 1.	Attrition Patterns
#### Nearly 49% of total employee exits occur within the first year of tenure, indicating that early-stage employment is the most vulnerable period for turnover. Exit concentration declines steadily as tenure increases, suggesting that employees who remain beyond the first year are significantly more likely to stay long-term. This pattern highlights potential gaps in onboarding effectiveness, role clarity, or early employee engagement, reinforcing the need for targeted retention strategies during the first 6–12 months of employment.

### 2.	Departmental Risk Areas
#### The Executive Office and Admin Offices recorded the highest attrition rates at 80% and 60%, respectively, significantly exceeding other departments. This suggests structural retention challenges within these functional areas. Targeted departmental review and retention diagnostics may be necessary to identify root causes and mitigate turnover risk.

### 3.	Workforce Composition
#### The workforce is relatively balanced across employment types, with contract employees representing the largest share (33.4%), followed by full-time (23.1%), temporary (22.0%), and part-time employees (21.5%). The higher proportion of contract staff indicates a substantial reliance on flexible employment arrangements, which may provide operational agility but could also have implications for workforce stability and long-term retention.

### 4.	Engagement Index (Derived)
#### The Employee Engagement Index was derived using a weighted combination of tenure stability, training participation, and employment status, providing a proxy measure of overall workforce engagement in the absence of survey data. With a score of 58.39, the index indicates moderate engagement levels, suggesting there is room for improvement in strengthening employee commitment and long-term retention

## Recommendations
### 1. Strengthen early-stage onboarding and retention initiatives
#### Enhance onboarding programs, mentorship, and early engagement efforts during the first 6–12 months of employment, as nearly half of all exits occur within this period. Improving early employee experience may significantly reduce overall attrition.
### 2. Conduct targeted retention diagnostics in high-attrition departments
#### Perform department-level reviews in areas such as the Executive Office and Admin Offices, where attrition rates are highest, to identify potential structural, operational, or role-related retention challenges.
### 3. Review workforce composition and engagement strategies across employment types
#### Given the organization’s reliance on contract and other non-permanent employees, evaluate engagement, inclusion, and retention practices across all employment categories to ensure workforce stability and continuity.
### 4. Implement succession planning and knowledge transfer initiatives
#### With a significant proportion of employees in older age groups, proactive succession planning and structured knowledge transfer programs will help preserve institutional knowledge and maintain operational continuity.

## Project Impact
### If applied in a real organizational setting, this analysis would:
#### •	Enable HR teams to identify early attrition risks before escalation
#### •	Support data-driven workforce planning and retention strategies
#### •	Improve employee stability, reducing recruitment and onboarding costs
#### •	Provide leadership with a clear, high-level view of workforce health

## Limitations
#### •	The Engagement Index is derived, not survey-based, and should be interpreted as an analytical proxy rather than a psychological measure.
#### •	The dataset does not include performance ratings, compensation, or detailed engagement survey data.
#### •	Findings are limited to the variables available and may not capture all drivers of attrition.
